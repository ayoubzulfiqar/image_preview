# Image Preview

A new Random Image Preview Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a image preview app that get the random image from the internet and display on the screen.
This app actually display image randomly like no fixation the image may can surprise you some times.
Because the Unsplash is a big website so the image can be like totally random.
Soon I will implement the set wallpaper functionality.
